Oh boy. This is a big one. Well, let's get into it.

**NOTE**: Forge 1.20 does not exist yet, due to an unforseen build issue.

+ A brand-new toast system was added! This one is a lot cleaner, and, most notably, clickable.
+ When your World Host version is outdated, it will let you know (can be disabled).
+ If you try to join a World Host IP with Direct Connect, World Host will automatically attempt to find an optimal way to connect.
+ It will no longer constantly attempt reconnects to the World Host server. Instead, a backoff will be applied.
+ You can now move the online status to other places on the screen! Support is also added for Main Menu Credits. The huge ugly gap on the lower-right of the Forge title screen is also no longer there.
+ Java 17 is no longer required on 1.17.1 and older versions of the game.
+ Support for Minecraft 1.17.1 was added.
+ Support for Minecraft 1.20 was added (only Fabric and Quilt for now).
+ Add better support for offline mode. You can now add friends directly via UUID. If you prefix a friend name with `o:`, they will be added as an offline mode friend.
+ German translations were added (credit to [EnZaXD](https://github.com/FlorianMichael) on GitHub).
