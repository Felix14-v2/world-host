+ Add a workaround for a weird behavior with some people's internet routers.
  + In some cases, the router would say UPnP would succeed when it in fact did not, which would cause the `tempip` IP and the friends list to cause timeouts.
  + If you're hosting a world and people joining run into a connection timeout, simply enable the "Don't Try UPnP" in the World Host settings (requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)).
+ Fix text boxes not having proper blinking cursors.
